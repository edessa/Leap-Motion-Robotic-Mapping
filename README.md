# Leap-Motion-Robotic-Mapping
This repository contains the source code for the mapping of leap motion finger movements and palm position to the Allegro anthropomorphic hand and the Baxter humanoid platform.
Inverse Kinematics is done in C++, Leap Motion ROS control is done in Python.

Not all code is put up, but by the end of the month I will have everything posted.
